Challenges you encountered during the project.
Your approach to solving these challenges.
Improvements you would make if given more time.

I chose to do the fylo data storage challenge as I like the look of the interface. My approach consisted of what I considered to be harder which was the loading bar (right box) and I focused on tackling that problem first, I assumed I would have to make a progress bar from scratch which I kind of managed to do until as I was doing research I found a progress bar module from bootstrap that was way easier to implement. After that I moved to the background of the website as I needed a box to judge how the background of the interface looked as well as adding the phone background. Then I worked on the right box which happened to be harder as all of the different rows and colummns were hard to get right without adding more divs/containers that I needed to add into my css file. I believe because of this, A lot of things that could be bootstrap are not because I was tweaking so much to get it to look right. Finally I implemented the change in viewport resulting in a different view and added some finishing touches like making sure the font was right and colors matched etc. 

Reflection: 
As already stated above, I encountered a Lot of challenges that seemed to stem from me focusing on building one box at a time, I would like to see what changes if instead of focusing on one box at a time, I worked in layers starting at the background and moving to the highest thing like the logo and the progress bar, I think it would save me some headache where things were shuffled and out of place. If given more time, I'd work through the styles a little more closesly, like as of writing this I know that the sentence "Youâ€™ve used 815 GB of your storage" is stylisticly cut in half and the left half is slightly higher than the right, I couldnt figure out how to do that without creating 2 seperate text boxes that were offset from one another and I'd like to explore that in the future, the same goes for the amount of storage left in the white box as the white box is a weird shape and the text is also stylized. Also not being able to use figma for exact pixel measurements really sucks for this one as I feel as though my version is slightly off from the template which is just going to happen when I can't measure out the exact specifications of boxes and text.
